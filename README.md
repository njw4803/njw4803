  - I'm a Back-end Developer
  - In everything, I consider foundations and principles to be the most important.
  - With experience designing, developing, and operating web services, we are always thinking about back-end architectures and      patterns that are highly scalable and maintainable.
  - I'm aiming for a clean code
  - We place importance on growing together by sharing information and thoughts through collaboration with fellow developers.
